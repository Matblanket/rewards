This script is a simple Bash program that plays a song for a minute when run and saves the timestamp of played seconds in a var.txt file. The script uses ffmpeg to cut the song into 60-second clips and mkv to play the audio clips and record the timestamp.

When the script is run, it cuts the song into 60-second clips and plays each clip for one minute. It then records the timestamp of each second that the audio clip is played and saves it in a var.txt file, which can be used for further analysis or processing.

To use this script, you need to have ffmpeg and mkv installed on your system. Once installed, simply run the script and enjoy the song. The timestamp of each second played will be saved in the var.txt file located in the same directory as the script.
